# Did It Move
A simple Android app that can detect if someone use your phone when you are leaving.
## Guidance
Copy the app-release.apk file in app folder to your Android Phone and install it.

Or you can download and install Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) to open it.
First you need to clone it from git:

```
git clone https://github.com/gaocan1992/DidItMove
```
In Android Studio, you can import existing project that you have cloned from git
